# M-Files

A collection of useful Matlab m-files that I have accumulated over the years.

## Installation

"Installation" here just means adding the folder to your Matlab [path](http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/matlab_env/br5tea6-6.html).  The first step is to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/dantswain/m-files.git
    
Alternatively, you can download the zip file from https://github.com/dantswain/m-files but with git you'll have the ability to easily pull changes and additions.

Once you have the files, you can either manually add the directory to the Matlab path or just run the `install` script to do it automatically.  You should only have to do this once.

## Files

More documentation coming later.  The individual files are documented as well.
